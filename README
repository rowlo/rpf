RPF (Rowlo Persistence Framework) is a set of shared libraries that provide a basic persistable data model element, a common persistence layer, and a persistence implementation for sqlite databases.

The libraries allow you to create, read, update, and delete instances of PersistableModelElements (or subclasses) in an almost transparent way.
